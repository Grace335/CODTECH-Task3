### Project Overview: **Throw Your Thought**

### Key Features:

1. **Navigation Bar**: 
   - The navbar is built with a responsive design, featuring a logo and a search bar for users to easily find content.
   - Users can access additional options via icons, including notifications, profile, and a writing button to create a new blog.

2. **Blog Writing Editor**:
   - A dedicated space for users to write and publish their blogs. It includes a simple, user-friendly interface with fields for the blog title and content.
   - The editor provides two main actions: **Publish** to share the blog and **Cancel** to discard changes.

3. **Main Content Section**:
   - The hero section introduces the platform with a welcoming message, inviting users to start writing or reading.
   - Buttons in this section guide users to either begin writing a blog or browse the available blogs.

4. **Blog List**:
